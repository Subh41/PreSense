## üìå Overview
This notebook extends the preprocessing pipeline by extracting **meaningful features** from lung sound recordings.  
Feature extraction bridges the gap between raw signals and machine learning models, enabling accurate classification of respiratory conditions (**Normal, Asthma, Pneumonia**).  

The workflow covers:  
1. **Time-domain features**  
2. **Frequency-domain features**  
3. **Spectral descriptors**

## üìë Extracted Features
Each audio frame was characterized using **spectral descriptors**, including:  
- **SCN**: Spectral Centroid  
- **SCR**: Spectral Crest  
- **SDC**: Spectral Decrease  
- **SEN**: Spectral Entropy  
- **SFL**: Spectral Flatness  
- **SFLUX**: Spectral Flux  
- **SRO**: Spectral Roll-off  
- **SSL**: Spectral Slope  
- **SSP**: Spectral Spread

## üîó Feature Correlations
Understanding inter-feature dependencies is crucial for model selection and dimensionality reduction.

- **Overall correlation (all classes):**  
  Strong correlations between SCN, SDC, SEN, and SRO.
