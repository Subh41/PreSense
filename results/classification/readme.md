## ðŸ“Œ Overview
This notebook demonstrates the **classification of respiratory conditions** (Normal, Asthma, Pneumonia) using **spectral features** extracted in Notebook 2.  
Multiple machine learning algorithms are applied, and their performance is evaluated using confusion matrices, accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and statistical significance testing.

## ðŸ“Š Dataset Split
The dataset was divided into training and testing sets:  

- **Training samples:** 14,879  
- **Testing samples:** 6,378

## ðŸ§  Classifiers Evaluated
The following models were tested:  

1. **LD** â€“ Linear Discriminant  
2. **KNB** â€“ Kernel NaÃ¯ve Bayes  
3. **FT** â€“ Fine Tree  
4. **GNB** â€“ Gaussian NaÃ¯ve Bayes  
5. **FKNN** â€“ Fine K-Nearest Neighbors  
6. **BT** â€“ Bagged Trees  
7. **SKNN** â€“ Subspace K-Nearest Neighbors

## ðŸ“Š Statistical Significance Testing
To ensure differences in classifier performance are not due to chance, **McNemarâ€™s Test** was applied.  

### ðŸ”Ž McNemarâ€™s Test vs SVM  
All models showed **statistically significant differences** compared to SVM at **95% confidence**.

### ðŸ”Ž McNemarâ€™s Test vs FT (Fine Tree)  
Fine Tree was compared against all other models, and the results confirm its superiority with statistically significant differences.

## âœ… Summary & Insights
- **Best Performing Models:**  
  - **Bagged Trees (BT)** and **Fine Tree (FT)** achieved the **highest accuracy (~98%)** and F1-scores (~0.97â€“0.98).  
- **Moderate Performance:**  
  - **FKNN** and **SKNN** scored ~85% accuracy and F1 ~0.82.  
- **Weaker Performance:**  
  - **LD, KNB, GNB** underperformed (<65% accuracy, low F1).  
- **Statistical Testing:**  
  - Confirmed **FT and BT significantly outperform other models**.  

ðŸ“Œ **Conclusion:**  
Tree-based ensemble methods (**BT, FT**) provide the most reliable classification of lung sounds, with results statistically validated using McNemarâ€™s Test.
