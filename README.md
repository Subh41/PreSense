## 📖 Overview
This repository accompanies the IEEE conference paper:

**“Spectral Analysis of Lungs sounds for Classification of Asthma and Pneumonia Wheezing”** (ICECCE 2020, Istanbul, Turkey).

Lung sounds provide critical diagnostic information. Wheezing is a key indicator of pulmonary illnesses such as **Asthma** and **Pneumonia**. This project presents a **complete ML pipeline** — from preprocessing raw lung sounds, to spectral feature extraction, and classification via **Support Vector Machine (SVM)** with an accuracy of **96.7%**.

## 🛠️ How to Run

---
### 1) Preprocessing
Open `notebooks/preprocessing.ipynb` in Jupyter/Kaggle. It demonstrates:
- **Normalization** (Min–Max scaling)
- **Segmentation** (250 ms frames)
- **Butterworth bandpass filtering** (250 Hz – 2 kHz)

## 📌 Overview
This notebook focuses on preprocessing lung sound recordings for respiratory disease classification.  
The workflow consists of **three key stages**:  
1. **Normalization** – removing amplitude variations.  
2. **Segmentation** – dividing signals into frames.  
3. **Filtration** – applying band-pass filtering to isolate useful frequency bands.  

The processed signals are later used for **feature extraction** and **classification** of respiratory conditions such as **Normal**, **Asthma**, and **Pneumonia**.  

## 🎚 Step 1: Band-pass Filtering
To remove unwanted low- and high-frequency components, a **10th-order Butterworth band-pass filter** was applied.  
This retains only frequencies between **150 Hz – 2000 Hz**, where most lung sound information lies.

## 📏 Step 2: Dimension & Framing Report
Input signals were preprocessed and segmented into overlapping frames:  
- Sampling rate: **44.1 kHz**  
- Frame length: **0.25s (11025 samples)**  
- Hop size: **0.125s (5512 samples, 50% overlap)**  

Frames with silence were removed, leaving ~80% of useful frames.

## 🫁 Step 3: Preprocessed Lung Sounds (Overlay)
Signals for different classes (Normal, Asthma, Pneumonia) after preprocessing, plotted in the **time domain**.  

![Preprocessed time domain overlay](./results/preprocessing/3.png)

Similarly, in the **frequency domain** we observe different spectral patterns among the classes.  

![Preprocessed frequency domain overlay](./results/preprocessing/4.png)

## 📊 Step 4: Class-wise Visualization
### Time Domain (per class)
- **Normal:** Clear periodic bursts.  
- **Asthma:** Weak, noisy signal with irregular patterns.  
- **Pneumonia:** Distorted and suppressed signal structure.  

![Time domain per class](./results/preprocessing/5.png)

### Frequency Domain (per class)
Each respiratory condition shows a distinct spectral signature:  
- **Normal:** Strong low-frequency energy.  
- **Asthma:** Broader spread with weaker energy.  
- **Pneumonia:** Different high-frequency attenuation.  

![Frequency domain per class](./results/preprocessing/6.png)


## ✅ Summary
The preprocessing pipeline ensures that lung sound signals are:  
- **Normalized** to remove amplitude variations.  
- **Segmented** into meaningful frames.  
- **Filtered** to retain medically relevant frequency ranges.  

This structured approach lays the foundation for **robust feature extraction and classification** in later stages.

### 2) Feature Extraction
We extract **nine spectral features**:
Spectral Centroid, Spectral Crest, Spectral Decrease, Spectral Entropy, Spectral Flatness, Spectral Flux, Spectral Roll‑off, Spectral Slope, Spectral Spread.

## 📌 Overview

Feature extraction bridges the gap between raw signals and machine learning models, enabling accurate classification of respiratory conditions (**Normal, Asthma, Pneumonia**).  

The workflow covers:  
1. **Time-domain features**  
2. **Frequency-domain features**  
3. **Spectral descriptors**
